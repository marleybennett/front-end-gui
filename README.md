# front-end-gui
Front end GUI software for ECE 342: Junior Design Final Project -- Motor Motion Control group.

This project will ultimately serve as the front end interface for a motion motor controller.  This motor is designed for use with Oregon State's Mars Rover arm.

The GUI will allow users to modify motion control parameters as well as view data from a quadrature encoder that relays details about the motor's current state.
